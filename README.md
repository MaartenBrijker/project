# project: DEVORM RECORDS presents an user-interactive music release

For the record label DEVORM records, I am building an app that generates music on the basis of user made choices. 
Hereby DEVORM makes it possible for fans and consumers to not only purchase/listen to the music we put out, but now also to be part of the label. 
The music that will be generated by the user will be unique, but still be constrained by the tools DEVORM provides and the aesthetics build into the app.
To state this more explicetly, this app will not be a generetic tool to make music, but will have a skin of DEVORM layered on top of this.
