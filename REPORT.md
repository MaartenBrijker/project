# DEVORM RECORDS presents an user-interactive music release

This app generates music by letting users edit audio files and record this in real time. These audio files are partly fixed by a pre-supplied audio in the app, and possibly expanded by recordings of the device's mic. The user is able to upload his final recordings to a shared dropbox, with their unique choosen tracktitle and artistname. Editing audio files can be done by changing a sound's pitch, reverb, filter and volume. The audiofiles in the app will be a collection of specifically composed pieces of short music by several artists.

This release will be part of DEVORM records, a cross-disciplinairy creative platform run by me. This app challenges the way we view an artwork by releasing a piece of music without a fixed final result. Releasing a tool to make music (esthetically constrained by the label) rather than a piece of music. The specific music of the release depends both on the provided audiofiles from artists as on the choices made by the user of the app. Hereby this app transforms a music release to a more wider feedbacking tool between artist and consumer (and whether this seperation even still can be made).

All the uploaded audio files are collected in a public dropbox, for everyone to enjoy.
